Rounded edges [^][contents]
---------------------------

This section is split in 2 parts:
- Modules and functions to create different configurable edges to add or
  remove from objects.
- Existing modules which are extended with fillet edges.

#### Repeating options: [^][contents]

- `type`
  - describe the type of the fillet edge
    - as value: set the same type for all edges
    - as list:  set the chamfer types of the respective edge individually
  - chamfer types:
    - `0` = no chamfer (default)
    - `1` = rounding
    - `2` = chamfer
  - the count of edges depends on the figures
    - `cube()`   has 12 edges
    - `square()` has  4 edges
- `edges`
  - describe the parameter of the chamfer from each fillet edge,
    depending on the type
    - a numeric value set the same value for all edges
    - a list set the value of each respective edge individually
  - possible values for an edge:
    - `0`         = not chamfered
    - greater `0` = radius or width of the chamfered edge
  - the count of edges depends on the figures,
    the size and the positions of the respective edge in the list
    are the same like in parameter `type`
- `corner`
  - describe which corner should be chamfered
    - a numeric value set the same value for all corners
    - a list set the value of each respective edge individually
  - possible values for a corner:
    `0` = not chamfered
    `1` = chamfered
  - the count of corners depends on the figures
    - `cube()`   has 8 corners
    - `square()` has 4 corners

_Location of the edges specified on the lists_
_for example on a cube:_
```

    7 +---------+ 6
     /:        /|
  4 / :     5 / |
   +---------+  |
   |  + - - -|- +
   | 路 3     | / 2
   |路        |/
   +---------+
  0          1


   Z
   ^ .Y
   |/
   +--> X

```
| name               | position of edges
|--------------------|-------------------
| _bottom_           | `[0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-0]`
| _top_              | `[4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-4]`
| _side_ or _around_ | `[0-4, 1-5, 2-6, 3-7]`
| corner, _bottom_   | `[0,   1,   2,   3]`
| corner, _top_      | `[4,   5,   6,   7]`

- `type` and `edges` are defined on a cube as a 12 element list:
  - the first 4 elements correspond to:  _bottom_ - all 4 edges at the bottom,      first edge begins at front
  - the following 4 elements correspond: _top_    - all 4 edges at the top,         first edge begins at front
  - the last 4 elements correspond to:   _around_ - all vertical edges on the side, first edge begins at front left
- `corner` is defined on a cube as a 8 element list:
  - the first 4 elements correspond to: _bottom_ - all 4 corner at the bottom, first corner begins at front left
  - the last 4 elements correspond to:  _top_    - all 4 corner at the top,    first corner begins at front left

#### Module name convention: [^][contents]
On modules with the name `_fillet` on the end you can
specify the type of the chamfer.\
But these modules have specialized derivation modules
with only one chamfer type.
- `xxx`         - base module
- `xxx_fillet`  - edges can specified with option `type`
- `xxx_rounded` - with rounded edges
- `xxx_chamfer` - with chamfered edges

#### Module characteristic: [^][contents]
List of characteristic behavior of modules with fillet edges:
- The base module is shown by default, the edges must extra set
  - The type of the edge is set by default to _no fillet edge_.
  - If the edge type is set, all edges have the size `0`, means they are unset.
  - You can define every edge size specially with the parameter `edge`

_Details to the arguments:_
- `type` and `edges` are defined as a 12 element list.\
  This list is partitioned in 3 parts, each part correspond 4 edges at one side.
  The rotation of the 4 edges on each partition is left around, seen from above.
  - the first 4 elements correspond to:  All 4 edges at the bottom.      First edge begins at front.
  - the following 4 elements correspond: All 4 edges at the top.         First edge begins at front.
  - the last 4 elements correspond to:   All vertical edges on the side. First edge begins at front left.
- `corner` is defined on a cube as a 8 element list:
  This list is partitioned in 2 parts, each part correspond 4 edges at one side.
  The rotation of the 4 edges on each partition is left around, seen from above.
  - the first 4 elements correspond to: All 4 corner at the bottom. First corner begins at front left.
  - the last 4 elements correspond to:  All 4 corner at the top.    First corner begins at front left.

  - `0` = no chamfer (default)
  - `1` = rounding
  - `2` = chamfer
  - as number: set the same type for all 4 edges
  - as list:   set the edge type individually - `[p0, p1, p2, p3]`

### Helper functions [^][contents]

#### configure_edges [^][contents]
[configure_edges]: #configure_edges-
Sets the `edges` parameter of the module `cube_fillet()`.

3 groups of edges, each completely encompassing the cuboid:
- bottom, top, around
- left, right, forward
- front, back, sideways

In the 3 groups all edges will be defined 3 times each,
therefore there is a priority, the higher one overrides the lower one.
Individual edges can be set as undefined with `undef`.

Order, those further to the left overwrite those further to the right:
- bottom, top, around, left, right, forward, front, back, sideways

_Arguments:_
```OpenSCAD
configure_edges (bottom,top,around, left,right,forward, front,back,sideways, r, default)
```
- | edge argument | description                                | first edge   | rotation on cube
  |---------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------
  | `bottom`      | 4 edges around the rectangle on the bottom | front        | left around, seen from above
  | `top`         | 4 edges around the rectangle on the top    | front        | left around, seen from above
  | `around`      | 4 edges vertical from bottom the top       | front left   | left around, seen from above
  | `left`        | 4 edges around the rectangle left side     | bottom left  | left around, seen from the left
  | `right`       | 4 edges around the rectangle right side    | bottom right | left around, seen from the left
  | `forward`     | 4 edges horizontal from left to right      | bottom front | left around, seen from the left
  | `front`       | 4 edges around the rectangle front side    | bottom front | left around, seen from the front
  | `back`        | 4 edges around the rectangle back side     | bottom back  | left around, seen from the front
  | `sideways`    | 4 edges horizontal from front to back      | bottom right | left around, seen from the front
- `r`
  - optional parameter
  - All edges are multiplied by this value if specified.
  - If `r` is set, this value will multiplied with every edge size,
    so you can activate every specific edge with `1` and deactivate with `0`,
    all so activated edges so gets the size `r`.
- `default`
  - value taken for edges that have not been set
  - default = `0`, edge not rounded

_Return:_
- 12 element list:
  - the first 4 elements correspond to:  `bottom` - all 4 edges at the bottom
  - the following 4 elements correspond: `top`    - all 4 edges at the top
  - the last 4 elements correspond to:   `around` - all vertical edges on the side

#### configure_types [^][contents]
[configure_types]: #configure_types-
Sets the `type` parameter of the module `cube_fillet()`.

_Arguments:_
```OpenSCAD
configure_types (bottom,top,around, left,right,forward, front,back,sideways, default)

The same like [`configure_edges()`][configure_edges]
(but without parameter `r`)

#### configure_corner [^][contents]
[configure_corner]: #configure_corner-
Sets the `corner` parameter of the module `cube_fillet()`.

3 groups of corner, each completely encompassing the cuboid:
- bottom, top
- left, right
- front, back

In the 3 groups all corner will be defined 3 times each,
therefore there is a priority, the higher one overrides the lower one.
Individual corner can be set as undefined with `undef`.

Order, those further to the left overwrite those further to the right:
- bottom, top, left, right, front, back

_Arguments:_
```OpenSCAD
configure_corner (bottom,top, left,right, front,back, default)
```
- | edge argument | description                                 | first edge   | rotation on cube
  |---------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|------------------
  | `bottom`      | 4 corner around the rectangle on the bottom | front left   | left around, seen from above
  | `top`         | 4 corner around the rectangle on the top    | front left   | left around, seen from above
  | `left`        | 4 corner around the rectangle left side     | bottom front | left around, seen from the left
  | `right`       | 4 corner around the rectangle right side    | bottom front | left around, seen from the left
  | `front`       | 4 corner around the rectangle front side    | bottom right | left around, seen from the front
  | `back`        | 4 corner around the rectangle back side     | bottom right | left around, seen from the front

  - value taken for corner that have not been set
  - default = `0`, corner not rounded

_Return:_
- 8 element list:
  - the first 4 elements correspond to: `bottom` - all 4 corner at the bottom
  - the last  4 elements correspond to: `top`    - all 4 corner at the top
