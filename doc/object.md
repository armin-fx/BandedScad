```
| name               | position of edges
|--------------------|-------------------
| _bottom_           | `[0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-0]`
| _top_              | `[4-5, 5-6, 6-7, 7-4]`
| _side_ or _around_ | `[0-4, 1-5, 2-6, 3-7]`
| corner, _bottom_   | `[0,   1,   2,   3]`
| corner, _top_      | `[4,   5,   6,   7]`

- `type` and `edges` are defined on a cube as a 12 element list:
  - the first 4 elements correspond to:  _bottom_ - all 4 edges at the bottom,      first edge begins at front
  - the following 4 elements correspond: _top_    - all 4 edges at the top,         first edge begins at front
  - the last 4 elements correspond to:   _around_ - all vertical edges on the side, first edge begins at front left
- `corner` is defined on a cube as a 8 element list:
  - the first 4 elements correspond to: _bottom_ - all 4 corner at the bottom, first corner begins at front left
  - the last 4 elements correspond to:  _top_    - all 4 corner at the top,    first corner begins at front left

#### Module name convention: [^][contents]
On modules with the name `_fillet` on the end you can
specify the type of the chamfer.  
But these modules have specialized derivation modules
with only one chamfer type.
- `xxx`         - base module
- `xxx_fillet`  - edges can specified with option `type`
- `xxx_rounded` - with rounded edges
- `xxx_chamfer` - with chamfered edges

#### Module characteristic: [^][contents]
List of characteristic behavior of modules with fillet edges:
- The base module is shown by default, the edges must extra set
  - The type of the edge is set by default to _no fillet edge_.
  - If the edge type is set, all edges have the size `0`, means they are unset.
  - You can define every edge size specially with the parameter `edge`

It needs the point from the edge and the points of both sides outgoing from edge.

_Arguments:_
```OpenSCAD
edge_fillet_plane_to (origin, point1, point2, r, type, extra, directed)
```
- `origin` - point at the edge
- `point1` - first point, build the line `origin`->`point1`, first side of the edge
- `point2` - second point, build the line `origin`->`point2`, last side of the edge
- `r`     - parameter of the chamfer
- `type`  - specify, which chamfer type should be used for the edge
  - `0` = no chamfer (default)
  - `1` = rounding
  - `2` = chamfer
- `extra`  - set an amount extra overhang, because of z-fighting
  - default = constant `extra`
- `directed`
  - If the angle around the line from point1 to point2 counter clockwise
    is greater then 180掳, a chamfered edge is impossible to create.
    This parameter controls the behavior.
  - `true` = default, line is considered as directed  
    Create nothing if the angle is greater then 180掳.
  - `false`, line is considered as undirected  
    Flip the chamfered edge to the side with an angle < 180掳

- `edge_rounded_plane_to()` - creates a rounded edge
- `edge_chamfer_plane_to()` - creates a chamfered edge
